Route 43 Leader (Sightseer F, Flame Orb)
Intro:
"I'm looking for strong trainers in Johto, but I haven't found any. However, you seem promising. I can see it in your eyes. Let's battle then, but first I want to see you conquer this route by beating everyone."
Question:
"Excellent! I decided to show you my Flame Orb strategy. Let's battle?"
Refused:
"Aw... I was anxious! Don't make me wait!"
Seen:
"Let's see how strong Johto trainers can be."
Beaten:
"Awesome!"
After1:
"Wow! Looks like I was just searching in the wrong place! I'll give you a Flame Orb, but please be careful if you give it to a Pokémon."
After2:
"I love visiting new places and challenging every trainer there. I'll keep looking for strong trainers like you."

Route 44 Leader (Veteran M, Rocky Helmet)
Intro:
"My Pokémon are wearing Rocky Helmets. Wanna challenge them? Okay, then you gotta beat every trainer in this route."
Question:
"I saw these battles. Your Pokémon are really strong. Are you ready?"
Refused:
"So... You beat Team Rocket at Mahogany and you're scared of battling me? How bad... Just kidding. Take your time."
Seen:
"I'll show you the power of my helmets!"
Beaten:
"Hah. These helmets weren't enough."
After1:
"You're really strong for being so young. Keep it up! Take one of these helmets. You could give them a better use than me."
After2:
"Hmm... You seem to be a silent person. Has anybody told you that before?"
